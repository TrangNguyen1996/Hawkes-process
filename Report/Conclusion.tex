\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chapter:conclusion}
In this report, we have studied Hawkes process is a self-exciting stochastic process, which based on a counting process in which the intensity function depends on all previously occurred events. 

In the Chapter \ref{chapter:knowledge}, we have reviewed some basis knowledge such as point process, counting process, conditional intensity function, inhomogeneous Poisson process to apply for analysis of the Hawkes process.

In the Chapter \ref{chapter:hawkes}, we have studied two models to simulate Hawkes process: the intensity-based Hawkes process Model and cluster-based Hawkes process Model.

In the Chapter \ref{chapter:simulation}, we have simulated three algorithms such as inhomogeneous Poisson process, Intensity-based Hawkes Process and Cluster-based Hawkes Process in Matlab\textsuperscript{\textregistered} environment.

In the Chapter \ref{chapter:application}, we have studied an application of Hawkes process in seismology.\\
Currently, we only simulate one dimensional Hawkes processes. However, we can extend to simulate the multidimensional Hawkes processes in the future. This is a limitation of this report.
